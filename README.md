Causal Impact Analysis for E-Commerce Experiments

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for causal impact analysis in e-commerce, focusing on the effectiveness of new interactive assets (e.g., banners, pop-ups) on user engagement and conversion. The repository includes:
	1.	Synthetic Data Generation: Scripts to create realistic synthetic data that mimics real-world variability.
	2.	Data Output: Pre-generated datasets ready for analysis.
	3.	Causal Analysis: Implementation of meta-learners (S-Learner and T-Learner) to evaluate the impact of digital assets on user behavior.

The project is designed to guide analysts, data scientists, and product managers in evaluating the impact of experiments, identifying actionable insights, and optimizing user engagement strategies.
